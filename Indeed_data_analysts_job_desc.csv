69,"BACKGROUND ON IMPACT AND REACHBACKGROUND ON IMPACT AND REACHIMPACT Initiatives is a humanitarian NGO, based in Geneva, Switzerland. The organisation manages several initiatives, including the REACH Initiative. The IMPACT team comprises specialists in data collection, management and analysis, GIS and remote-sensing. IMPACT was launched at the initiative of ACTED, an international NGO whose headquarter is based in Paris and is present in thirty countries. The two organizations have a strong complementarity formalized in a global partnership, which allows particularly IMPACT to benefit from ACTED’s operational support on its fields of intervention.REACH was born in 2010 as a joint initiative of two International NGOs (IMPACT Initiatives and ACTED) and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT). REACH’s purpose to promote and facilitate the development of information products that enhance the humanitarian community’s decision making and planning capacity for emergency, reconstruction and development contexts, supporting and working within the framework of the humanitarian reform process. REACH facilitates information management for aid actors through three complementary services: (a) need and situation assessments facilitated by REACH teams; (b) situation analysis using satellite imagery; (c) provision of related database and (web)-mapping facilities and expertise.COUNTRY PROFILEIn North East Nigeria (NEN), the ongoing crisis continues to have a profound impact on the population, leading to displacement both within and out of the region and high rates of unmet needs among internally displaced persons. The conflict additionally exacerbates prior unmet needs among non-displaced and host communities. While the primary driver of the conflict remains violent conflict, including ISWAP (Islamic State West Africa Province), JAS (Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad) and associated armed opposition groups (AOGs), other underlying factors, such as climate change, poverty, and disease outbreaks, exacerbate need and further complicate aid delivery.Against the backdrop of this protracted crisis, the humanitarian situation in Northeast Nigeria remains one of the world’s most severe. Out of the Northeast’s Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (BAY) state’s total population of13 million people, an estimated 7.9 million are in need of humanitarian assistance.1 Borno state remains the epicentre of the crisis, containing over 80% of the region’s over 2 million internally displaced persons.2 Major incidents throughout 2019 have led to continued mass displacements and severely affected the provision of humanitarian assistance in the region.The sudden influx of arrivals added strain to the existing infrastructure of the humanitarian community, resulting in high rates of unmet needs, overcrowding in camps, and exposure to protection risks for vulnerable groups. The congestion status of the camps has resulted in over 60% of IDPs residing outside of camps within host communities, further complicating service delivery.3 The intensity of needs within Maiduguri and the instability of the security situation in more remote regions has resulted in increased focus on populations in accessible areas; however, populations in the less accessible areas are presumed to have even greater needs.These hard-to-reach areas are estimated to contain around 971,000 persons.4 Very little is known about the specific conditions and needs of the populations living in these areas, but they are presumed to have little mobility, limited essential services, and little or no access to humanitarian aid. The same threats that severely limit the ability of humanitarian actors to conduct thorough assessments also immediately affect the population living in the region. REACH’s Humanitarian Situation Monitoring (HSM) assessments in the Hard-to-Reach areas of Borno state have found that people in these inaccessible areas lack of access to basic services including health facilities, access to livelihoods and have decreased access to foods, access to improved water sources and access to humanitarian services.5As such, the needs for evidenced-based Humanitarian Aid and information on populations in both accessible and inaccessible areas is paramount to a coordinated response. REACH has been present in Nigeria since 2017, providing a growing evidence base for humanitarian response planning through sectoral, multi-sectoral and area-based assessments as well as information management services. In 2021, REACH is looking to continue to provide the humanitarian community with relevant and reliable information to strengthen strategic programming and needs-based targeting in Northeast Nigeria.More information can be found here: https://www.impact-initiatives.org/where-we-work/nigeria/POSITION PROFILEREACH’s Sectoral Team, in line with the global REACH 2.0 strategy of sector/cluster support, engages with sectors and working groups across the humanitarian response.

114,"BACKGROUND ON IMPACT AND REACHBACKGROUND ON IMPACT AND REACHIMPACT Initiatives is a humanitarian NGO, based in Geneva, Switzerland. The organisation manages several initiatives, including the REACH Initiative. The IMPACT team comprises specialists in data collection, management and analysis, GIS and remote-sensing. IMPACT was launched at the initiative of ACTED, an international NGO whose headquarter is based in Paris and is present in thirty countries. The two organizations have a strong complementarity formalized in a global partnership, which allows particularly IMPACT to benefit from ACTED’s operational support on its fields of intervention.REACH was born in 2010 as a joint initiative of two International NGOs (IMPACT Initiatives and ACTED) and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT). REACH’s purpose to promote and facilitate the development of information products that enhance the humanitarian community’s decision making and planning capacity for emergency, reconstruction and development contexts, supporting and working within the framework of the humanitarian reform process. REACH facilitates information management for aid actors through three complementary services: (a) need and situation assessments facilitated by REACH teams; (b) situation analysis using satellite imagery; (c) provision of related database and (web)-mapping facilities and expertise.COUNTRY PROFILEIn North East Nigeria (NEN), the ongoing crisis continues to have a profound impact on the population, leading to displacement both within and out of the region and high rates of unmet needs among internally displaced persons. The conflict additionally exacerbates prior unmet needs among non-displaced and host communities. While the primary driver of the conflict remains violent conflict, including ISWAP (Islamic State West Africa Province), JAS (Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad) and associated armed opposition groups (AOGs), other underlying factors, such as climate change, poverty, and disease outbreaks, exacerbate need and further complicate aid delivery.Against the backdrop of this protracted crisis, the humanitarian situation in Northeast Nigeria remains one of the world’s most severe. Out of the Northeast’s Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (BAY) state’s total population of13 million people, an estimated 7.9 million are in need of humanitarian assistance.1 Borno state remains the epicentre of the crisis, containing over 80% of the region’s over 2 million internally displaced persons.2 Major incidents throughout 2019 have led to continued mass displacements and severely affected the provision of humanitarian assistance in the region.The sudden influx of arrivals added strain to the existing infrastructure of the humanitarian community, resulting in high rates of unmet needs, overcrowding in camps, and exposure to protection risks for vulnerable groups. The congestion status of the camps has resulted in over 60% of IDPs residing outside of camps within host communities, further complicating service delivery.3 The intensity of needs within Maiduguri and the instability of the security situation in more remote regions has resulted in increased focus on populations in accessible areas; however, populations in the less accessible areas are presumed to have even greater needs.These hard-to-reach areas are estimated to contain around 971,000 persons.4 Very little is known about the specific conditions and needs of the populations living in these areas, but they are presumed to have little mobility, limited essential services, and little or no access to humanitarian aid. The same threats that severely limit the ability of humanitarian actors to conduct thorough assessments also immediately affect the population living in the region. REACH’s Humanitarian Situation Monitoring (HSM) assessments in the Hard-to-Reach areas of Borno state have found that people in these inaccessible areas lack of access to basic services including health facilities, access to livelihoods and have decreased access to foods, access to improved water sources and access to humanitarian services.5As such, the needs for evidenced-based Humanitarian Aid and information on populations in both accessible and inaccessible areas is paramount to a coordinated response. REACH has been present in Nigeria since 2017, providing a growing evidence base for humanitarian response planning through sectoral, multi-sectoral and area-based assessments as well as information management services. In 2021, REACH is looking to continue to provide the humanitarian community with relevant and reliable information to strengthen strategic programming and needs-based targeting in Northeast Nigeria.More information can be found here: https://www.impact-initiatives.org/where-we-work/nigeria/POSITION PROFILEREACH’s Sectoral Team, in line with the global REACH 2.0 strategy of sector/cluster support, engages with sectors and working groups across the humanitarian response.

Engagements include conducting assessments, supporting in analysis, building capacity building, supporting coordination and strategic engagement to promote innovative methods towards understanding sector-related needs in North East Nigeria.RESPONSIBILITIESUnder the direct supervision of the REACH Senior Assessment Officer for the Sectoral Team, the Nutrition Assessment Officer (NAO) will be responsible for assessing nutrition, health, and mortality needs and conditions in North East Nigeria and for working closely with other sectoral specialists and REACH teams to provide relevant analysis to the humanitarian response.This includes:In collaboration with the Sectoral Unit Senior Assessment Officer, and under the guidance of the Deputy Country Coordinator, providing support to humanitarian actors in Nigeria working in the field of Nutrition, specifically including the Nutrition Cluster with relevant and timely data and analysis;Further developing and expanding REACH’s nutrition and health portfolios, ensuring close collaboration with other sector-specific analysts including the WASH;Supporting the development of new projects and programme strategies, as well as the production of donor reports and new proposals;Conducting nutrition assessments either as technical support to nutrition partners in Nigeria, or as ad hoc rapid nutrition assessments, including the design, planning, training and implementation, data cleaning and analysis, and reporting of the assessment results;Representing REACH Nigeria in Nutrition and Health Sector meetings and as a technical representative on the Nutrition Information Working Group (NIWG);Providing ad hoc technical support to the Nutrition Cluster or the NIWG in the analysis of nutrition data or other secondary data sources, or technical training of staff, as requested;Participating in the Cadre Harmonise (CH) analysis workshops for Acute Malnutrition;Providing technical support to other REACH departments on the collection or interpretation of nutrition, health, and mortality data as requested;Coordinating and ensuring timely data collection, including management of field staff where relevant;In coordination with the REACH Country Coordinator, Deputy Country Coordinator and Sectoral Team Senior Assessment Officer, representing REACH externally with donors, partners and the wider aid community through sectors and working groups.CONFIDENTIALITYThe NAO will maintain the strictest confidentiality on all data collected and related processes.

146,"Overview:The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.orgCHAI's Vaccines ProgramImmunization is one of the most successful public health interventions in history. National immunization programs reach >100 million infants every year and have, across the globe, averted two to three million deaths every year since the launch of the Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) in 1974. The introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and rotavirus vaccines could save a further ~1 million lives per year. Furthermore, great advances in the development and financing of new vaccines provides countries the opportunity to further reduce the burden of diseases such as human papillomavirus (HPV).However, despite these successes, 1.5 million children still die each year of vaccine-preventable diseases. Many of these are in low-income countries, where immunization programs face unprecedented challenges in accessing vaccines and ensuring they reach all targeted children.Since 2010, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) has worked to save lives and reduce the burden from vaccine preventable diseases by improving access to immunization services in resource-limited setting. CHAI does this by strengthening national immunization programs at the country level, and the leveraging that experience to improve the global immunization ecosystem. Within that effort, CHAI is pursuing six complementary strategic goals:Improving affordability and supply security of immunization products;Accelerating the uptake of new or under-utilized vaccines;Enhancing the performance of vaccine cold chain and logistics systems to increase effective immunization coverage;Improving the design and implementation of service delivery to reach the unreached;Supporting successful transition from Gavi support; andStrengthening the management system and capacity of immunization programs.CHAI's vaccine program closely supports the national immunization programs in 11 focus countries - Cameroon, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Lao PDR, Lesotho, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Vietnam - and also engages with global stakeholders such as Gavi, WHO and UNICEF to inform global policies and practices.Improving Vaccines Supply ChainsMost vaccines must travel through supply chains containing between three and five—sometimes more—storage points to get to the last mile. In order to be available to be administered, vaccines must be correctly forecasted, ordered for accurately, managed well in-store, issued and selected for distribution accurately, and delivered on-time and in-full to their next destination. However, many countries struggle to keep all of these processes running smoothly, which threatens full stock availability at the last mile. Supply chains are further strained as countries introduce more vaccines to protect children from a wider range of diseases. For example, a recent study found that 38% of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa reported national-level stock-outs. When this happens, according to the study, there is an 89% chance that a stock-out will occur lower in the supply chain, often negatively affecting the last-mile.To help ensure that children are able to access the full schedule of life-saving vaccines, CHAI supports supply chain work in several countries that is focused on ensuring that certain core elements and practices are in place:Critical supply chain processes—forecasting, ordering, issuing, distribution, etc.—have high-quality, well-defined processes that are adhered to by all staff throughout the supply chain.Supply chain managers and EPI programs have visibility into critical data points and key performance indicators, such as stock-outs, on-time in-full distribution, and order accuracy.Supply chain leaders, at each critical supply chain tier, regularly meet to review performance data, identify problematic performance areas, and implement solutions.We are seeking a Senior Analyst to join the global vaccines delivery team and contribute to CHAI's work in vaccine supply chain globally and across all its focus countries, in collaboration with another global area owners.Base location has global flexibility with a strong preference for one of CHAI’s Vaccine Program focus countries in Africa, pursuant to CHAI country team leadership approval.
